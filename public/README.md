- **profile.jpg** — Your profile photo for the About (cover) section. Add your image here with this exact name. If the file is missing, a placeholder circle is shown instead.
  - Supported formats: use `.jpg` (or rename your `.png` / `.webp` to `profile.jpg`, or see below to use another filename).
  - Recommended size: at least 320×320 px (square works best; it’s displayed as a circle).
